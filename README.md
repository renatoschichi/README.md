😃 Team Work

🏡 Working From Home

I have experience in web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, using frameworks like Angular, bootstrap, ngx, material, and primeng. I also do unit tests using "Jest", to work with development best practices and ensure code quality. I know programming logic, agility, and great teamwork.

I work with git version control in all projects, following the git standard and using the GitHub/GitLab repository.

I've also worked with WordPress website development for several companies, along with social media outreach work both in content generation and paid traffic, SEO, and email marketing.
